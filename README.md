### 1. Description
Fullstack single-page application, which enables users to create or search for prompts and use them in their communication with Chat GPT.
In order to generate specific prompts, users can sing in in their own profile or preview other's users profiles. 
Users can also browse the current active community, their prompts and search them via tag, prompt or username.
This is a personal project, part of Youtube Next.js course.
